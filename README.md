# DreamPicoPort-TUI

A fork of [OrangeFox86/DreamPicoPort](https://github.com/OrangeFox86/DreamPicoPort) that
adds a USB keyboard client, a serial configuration console, and an optional OLED status
display. Upstream's own README follows below unchanged.

## What this fork adds

**USB keyboard to Dreamcast keyboard.** Upstream shipped a complete `DreamcastKeyboard`
Maple implementation that nothing ever instantiated, and a USB host layer that only handled
gamepads. This adds the glue. No usage code translation is needed: the Dreamcast reports the
same HID usage codes a USB keyboard does, and the modifier byte matches on bits 0 through 6.

**Settings over the serial console.** Upstream exposes configuration only over WebUSB, which
means a browser is the only way to configure a device. The same fields are now reachable
from the tty parser under `=`, as line oriented text that a person can type and a script can
parse. The WebUSB path is untouched.

**An optional SSD1306 status display.** Three pages, cycled by a button: typing stats
(words and characters per minute), a debug page (usb vid:pid, raw HID report, Maple poll
rate, player slot), and a title card. Useful for bringing up a new device without attaching
a laptop and two serial terminals.

**Build fixes.** Upstream does not currently build against pico-sdk 2.3.0 with a modern ARM
toolchain. Three commits fix that, and a fourth fixes a signed overflow in upstream's
keyboard code that had never been compiled because nothing instantiated the class. Those
four are self contained and would apply upstream unchanged.

**The WebUSB landing page** now points here rather than upstream, and the browser
announcement defaults off, since this fork configures over serial.

## Targets

    client-with-usb-keyboard       the adapter
    client-with-usb-keyboard-dbg   same, plus UART tracing on GP0 at 115200
    client-with-usb-keyboard-oled  same, plus the display
    bench-host                     turns a spare RP2040 into a fake Dreamcast for desk testing

## Building

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk
cmake --build build --target client-with-usb-keyboard
```

`-DPICO_SDK_PATH` is not optional: upstream's `CMakeLists.txt` accepts the environment
variable on one line and dereferences the unset CMake variable on the next.

Useful overrides:

    -DKBD_BUS_START_PIN=14      SDCKA pin, SDCKB is the next one up. Default 6
    -DKBD_LED_ACTIVE_LOW=false  a Pico's GP25 is active high, a XIAO's is not
    -DKBD_LANGUAGE=1 -DKBD_TYPE=7   Japan / 106 key instead of America / 104
    -DKBD_LED_WRITEBACK=0       do not push lock LED state back to the keyboard

## Wiring

Defaults target a Seeed XIAO RP2040 wired straight to a controller cable with no bus
transceiver. Identify every conductor with a meter rather than by pin number or wire
colour, since neither is standardised across cables.

    Dreamcast        XIAO
    data             D4   (GP6)   SDCKA
    data             D5   (GP7)   SDCKB
    +5V              5V
    GND              GND
    sense            GND

    debug UART  ->   D6   (GP0), 115200 8N1, receive only
    OLED SDA    ->   D0   (GP26), SCL -> D1 (GP27), VCC -> 3V3
    page button ->   D2   (GP28) to GND, internal pull up

Which data line is SDCKA and which is SDCKB cannot be determined with a meter. If the
console sees nothing, swap those two before suspecting anything else.

## Status

The keyboard client is verified on real hardware: a console assigns a player slot, polls the
adapter, and keystrokes cross from USB to Maple. Modifiers and five key rollover work. The
display and the serial settings console are also verified.

Known gaps:

- Declared current draw of 20/50 mA is a guess and is almost certainly low. This adapter is
  an RP2040 plus a bus powered keyboard, realistically over 100 mA. Measure before relying
  on it, since the console fuses one 5V rail across all four ports.
- The device info version string is invented, not a dump of a real HKT-7620.
- Gamepad support is still DS4 only, inherited from upstream.

# Quick Installation Guide

These instructions have been moved to [the wiki](https://github.com/OrangeFox86/DreamPicoPort/wiki/Installation-Guide).

# Build Instructions (for Linux and Windows)

If running under Windows, install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and your desired flavor of Linux. I recommend using Ubuntu 22.04 as that is what I have used for development. Then the steps below may be run within your WSL instance.

1. Install git, cmake, and gcc-arm-none-eabi compiler by running the following commands
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install git cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

2. (optional) In order to run and debug tests, install standard gcc compilers and gdb by running the following
```bash
sudo apt -y install build-essential gdb
```

3. Clone this repo then cd into the created directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tails86/DreamPicoPort.git
cd DreamPicoPort
```

4. Pull down the pico SDK (this project now uses a fork of the SDK - it will no longer compile under the standard SDK)
```bash
git submodule update --recursive --init
```
Hint: if you have issues building, the easiest way to correct any submodule synchronization issue is to delete the `ext/pico-sdk` directory (ex: `rm -rf ext/pico-sdk`), restore the directory `git restore ext/pico-sdk`, and then re-run the above submodule update command.

5. (optional) Build and run tests - this runs core lib unit tests locally
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

6. Execute the build script
```bash
./build.sh
```

After build completes, binaries should be located under `dist/`. Pre-built release binaries may be found [here](https://github.com/OrangeFox86/DreamPicoPort/releases).

This project may be opened in vscode. In vscode, the default shortcut `ctrl+shift+b` will build the project. The default shortcut `F5` will run tests with gdb for local debugging. Open the terminal tab after executing tests with debugging to see the results.

# Maple Bus Implementation

The Maple Bus is a serial communications protocol which Dreamcast uses to communicate with controllers and other peripherals. Refer to documentation [here](https://dreamcast.wiki/Maple_bus) for general information about the Maple Bus.

## Why the RP2040/RP2350 are Game Changers for Emulating Communication Protocols

To emulate a bespoke communication protocol such as the Maple Bus on an MCU, one would usually either need to add extra hardware or bit bang the interface. This is not true with the RP2040/RP2350 and their PIO. Think of it as several extra small processors on the side using a special machine language purpose-built for handling I/O. This means communication can be offloaded to the PIO and only check on them after an interrupt is activated or a timeout has elapsed. Check out [maple_in.pio](src/hal/MapleBus/maple_in.pio) and [maple_out.pio](src/hal/MapleBus/maple_out.pio) to see the PIO code.

Luckily, the RP2040/RP2350 come with 2 PIO blocks each with 4 separate state machines. This means that the RP2040/RP2350 can easily emulate 4 separate controller interfaces, each at full speed!

## Interfacing with the PIO State Machines

The [MapleBus class](src/hal/MapleBus/MapleBus.hpp) operates as the interface between the microcontroller's code and the PIO state machines, [maple_in.pio](src/hal/MapleBus/maple_in.pio) and [maple_out.pio](src/hal/MapleBus/maple_out.pio).

Using 2 separate PIO blocks for reading and writing is necessary because each PIO block can only hold up to 32 instructions, and this interface is too complex to fit both read and write into a single block. Therefore, the write state machine is completely stopped before starting the read state machine for the targeted bus. Switching state machines is fast enough that there shouldn't be a problem. Testing showed the handoff always occurs within 1 microsecond after bringing the bus back to neutral. A device on the Maple Bus starts responding some time after 50 microseconds from the point of the bus going neutral after an end sequence. This ensures that a response is always captured.

The following lays out the phases of the state machine handled within the MapleBus class.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/MapleBus_Class_State_Machine.png?raw=true" alt="MapleBus Class State Machine"/>
</p>

### PIO Data Handoff

When the write method is called, data is loaded into the Direct Memory Access (DMA) channel designated for use with the maple_out state machine in the MapleBus instance. The DMA will automatically load data onto the TX FIFO of the output PIO state machine so it won't stall waiting for more data.

The first 32-bit word loaded onto the output DMA is how many transmission bits will follow. In order for the state machine to process things properly, `(x - 8) % 32 == 0 && x >= 40` must be true where x is the value of that first 32-bit word i.e. every word is 32 bits long and at least a frame word (32 bits) plus a CRC byte (8 bits) are in the packet. This value needs to be loaded with byte order flipped because byte swap is enabled in the DMA so that all other words are written in the correct byte order. The rest of the data loaded into DMA is the entirety of a single packet as a uint32 array. The last uint32 value holds the 8-bit CRC.

A blocking IRQ is triggered once the maple_out state machine completes the transfer. This then allows MapleBus to stop the maple_out state machine and start the maple_in state machine.

A Direct Memory Access (DMA) channel is setup to automatically pop items off of the RX FIFO of the maple_in state machine so that the maple_in state machine doesn't stall while reading. Once the IRQ is triggered by the maple_in state machine, MapleBus stops the state machine and reads from data in the DMA.

## Generating Maple Bus Output

The [maple_out PIO state machine](src/hal/MapleBus/maple_out.pio) handles Maple Bus output. Data is generated by following the signal definition [here](https://dreamcast.wiki/Maple_bus#Maple_Bus_Signals).

## Sampling Maple Bus Input

The [maple_in PIO state machine](src/hal/MapleBus/maple_in.pio) handles Maple Bus input. Some concessions had to be made in order to handle all input operations within the 32 instruction set limit of the input PIO block. The following are the most notable limitations.
- Only a standard data packet may be sampled
    - The Maple Bus protocol has different types of packets depending on how many times B pulses in the start sequence, but those packets are ignored in this implementation
- The full end sequence is not sampled
    - The packet length in the frame word plus the CRC are relied upon during post-processing in order to verify that the received packet is valid

### Sampling the Start Sequence

The input PIO state machine will wait until **A** transitions LOW and then count how many times **B** toggles LOW then HIGH while making sure **A** doesn't transition HIGH until after **B** transitions HIGH. If the toggle count isn't 4, then the state machine keeps waiting. Otherwise, the state machine signals the application with a non-blocking IRQ and continues to the next phase where data bits are sampled.

### Sampling Data Bits

For each bit, the state machine first waits for the designated clock to be HIGH before proceeding. Then once this line transitions to LOW, the state of the designated data line is sampled. State transitions of the designated data line are ignored except for the case when sensing the end sequence is required as described in the next section.

### Sampling the End Sequence

Whenever **A** is designated as the clock, the input PIO state machine will detect when **B** toggles HIGH then LOW while **A** remains HIGH. It is assumed that this is the beginning of the end sequence since this is not a normal behavior during data transmission. The state machine will then block on an IRQ so that the application can handle the received data.
